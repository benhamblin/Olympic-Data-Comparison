# Olympic Cycling Data Comparison - Web Programming Coursework

## Project Overview
This project is part of the COA123 - Web Programming module. It involves developing an interactive web application to compare Olympic cycling data between two countries. The primary focus is on Task 4, which requires creating a webpage for a comprehensive comparison based on various criteria.

## Task 4: Country Comparison Webpage
- **Functionality**: Users can input two country ISO IDs to compare their Olympic cycling performance.
- **Minimum Requirements**: Display the count of different types of medals (gold, silver, bronze, total) and list of cyclists from each country.
- **Extended Comparison**: Interactive options for users to rank countries based on gold medals, number of cyclists, and average age of cyclists during the London 2012 Olympics.
- **Interactive Elements**: Utilize AJAX requests or Fetch API and JSON for asynchronous webpage updates.

## Technical Specifications
- **Languages**: HTML, PHP, JavaScript.
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: jQuery, Chart.js, Bootstrap (optional).
- **Data Source**: Read-only MySQL database (provided).
- **Development Environment**: Ensure compatibility with Chrome on Windows.

## Implementation Details
- **Database Interaction**: Query data from provided MySQL database tables (country, cyclist, event).
- **User Interface**: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for effective comparison.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Chart.js for graphical representation of comparison data.

## Development Guidelines
- **Code Base**: Incorporate code from COA123 lectures and labs.
- **Directory Structure**: Place all PHP and start HTML files at the root level of the coursework folder on the sci-project server.
- **Validation and Responsiveness**: Ensure input validation and responsive design.

## Submission
- Upload all required files to your designated coursework folder on the sci-project server.
- Follow naming conventions and directory structure as specified in the coursework guidelines.
